These are my dotfiles and cheatsheets for basic Terminal setup on Linux / Windows WSL2.

# Setup Zsh/Starship
I use Zsh as my default shell, Oh-my-zsh for plugins and Startship for my prompt. The themes I have also require Nerd Fonts.

- Run the installation commands below
- copy .zshrc file and the directories into your `$HOME` directory
- you may need to tweak some settings and install extra dependencies to get it to work in your environment.  Refer to the documentation for Zsh, Oh-my-zsh and Startship prompt.

```
